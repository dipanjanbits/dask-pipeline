DASK MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE - ANALYSIS REPORT
===============================================

Generated: 2025-06-21 21:33:22

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------
This analysis demonstrates a working Dask-ML pipeline using only
the models and features that are actually available in the current
Dask-ML library.

MODELS TESTED
------------
Dask Models:
- Native Dask-ML Logistic Regression
- Dask-wrapped Random Forest (using ParallelPostFit)
- Incremental SGD Classifier

Traditional Models:
- Scikit-learn Logistic Regression
- Scikit-learn Random Forest
- Scikit-learn SGD Classifier

PERFORMANCE RESULTS
------------------
Training Time Results:
- dask_logistic_regression: 27.46s vs 4.19s (speedup: 0.15x)
- dask_random_forest: 10.73s vs 4.14s (speedup: 0.39x)


KEY FINDINGS
-----------
1. Dask-ML has limited native model implementations
2. Dask wrappers (ParallelPostFit, Incremental) extend functionality
3. Performance benefits depend on dataset size and available resources
4. Memory efficiency is a key advantage of Dask

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------
1. Use Dask for datasets that don't fit in memory
2. Leverage Dask wrappers for unsupported models
3. Consider network overhead in distributed setups
4. Start with smaller datasets to test your pipeline

TECHNICAL NOTES
--------------
- Dask Client: {self.n_workers} workers
- Dataset: Synthetic classification data
- Preprocessing: Dask-ML StandardScaler
- Evaluation: Accuracy and timing metrics

LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT DASK-ML
-----------------------------
- Limited native model selection
- Some algorithms require wrappers
- Documentation gaps for some features
- Version compatibility issues

CONCLUSION
----------
While Dask-ML has limitations, it provides valuable tools for
scaling machine learning workflows. The wrappers and incremental
learning capabilities make it useful for large-scale applications.
